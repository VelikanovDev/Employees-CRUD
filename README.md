# Employees CRUD

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing employees. It allows you to perform operations such as adding new employees, retrieving employee information, updating employee details, and deleting employees.

## Technologies Used

- Java 8
- Spring Framework (including Spring MVC and Spring ORM)
- Hibernate
- JSP (JavaServer Pages)
- JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)
- MySQL (relational database)
- Maven (build and dependency management)
- Tomcat (for deploying and running the application)

# Running the Application

To run the Employees CRUD application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the application source code.
2. Configure the database connection settings in the applicationContext.xml file. Make sure to set the correct JDBC URL, username, and password for your MySQL database.
3. Build the project.
4. Deploy the generated WAR (Web Application Archive) file to your Tomcat web server.
5. Start the Tomcat server by running the appropriate startup script for your operating system (startup.sh for Unix/Linux, startup.bat for Windows).
6. Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:8080/employees-crud in your web browser (assuming you're using the default Tomcat configuration).
7. You should now see the Employees CRUD application homepage and be able to perform CRUD operations on employee data.
